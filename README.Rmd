## Overview

This R package offers a fast, standardized and reproducible workflow for data
from cardiopulmonary exercise testing. It offers tools for data import,
processing, summary and visualization.

> WARNING: This package is currently under active development. At the moment, I
recommend to use it for demonstration or testing purposes only. When using
`spiro` for scientific analyses, make sure to state the exact package version,
as at this stage of development the package's functions may undergo major
changes.

## Background

Measuring gas exchange during physical exercise is a common procedure in sports science and medicine. It allows to assess the functional limit of the cardiovascular system, evaluate the success of training interventions, and diagnose cardio-respiratory diseases. The measuring devices of cardiopulmonary exercise testing --- so-called metabolic carts --- output their data in different formats. Moreover, measured breath-by-breath data is noisy and requires post-processing. This package standardizes the import and processing of raw data from different metabolic carts.

## Installation

Install the current development version from GitHub:

``` {r install-dev, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("smnnlt/spiro")
```

Install the latest version 0.0.5 release by running this code:

``` {r install, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("smnnlt/spiro@v0.0.5")
```

## Usage

Main functions:

* Use `spiro()` to automatically import and process raw data from
  cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
* Use `spiro_summary()` and `spiro_max()` for a stepwise summary or the 
  calculation of maximum parameter values.
* Use `spiro_plot()` to visualize the data.

Further functionality:

* Add external heart rate data from a .tcx file.
* Automated guessing or manual setting of exercise protocols.
* Different data filtering strategies for VO~2max~ determination (moving time averages, moving breath averages, Butterworth filters)
  
#### Metabolic Carts

The following metabolic carts are currently supported by `spiro`:

* Cortex
* Cosmed
* Vyntus
* ZAN

Support for further metabolic carts is planned for future releases.

## Example

```{r example, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
library(spiro)

# get data path for example
file <- spiro_example("zan_gxt")

gxt_data <- spiro(file)

spiro_summary(gxt_data)

spiro_max(gxt_data)

spiro_plot(gxt_data)
```

## Related Work

The [whippr](https://github.com/fmmattioni/whippr) package offers a different
approach to working with data from cardiopulmonary exercise testing. It
additionally offers functions for analyzing VO2 kinetics.
