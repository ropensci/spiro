## Overview

The goal of `spiro` is to enable a fast and standardised workflow with raw data
files from cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The package provides simple tools
for data import, processing, summary and visualisation.

> WARNING: This package is currently under early development. It is recommended
to use this software for demonstrational or testing purposes only. We advise
against using it for scientific analyses at the moment, as at this stage of
development major changes in the package's computations may occur.


## Installation

Install the current development version from GitHub:

``` {r installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("smnnlt/spiro")
```

## Usage

* Use `spiro()` for one-step data import and processing from raw metabolic cart
  files. 
* Use `spiro_summary()` and `spiro_max()` for a stepwise summary or a 
  calculation of maximum parameter values.
* Use `spiro_plot()` to visualising the data.
  
#### Metabolic Carts

The following metabolic carts are currently supported by `spiro`:

* CORTEX
* COSMED
* ZAN

## Example

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(spiro)

# get data for example
file <- spiro_example("zan_gxt")

gxt_data <- spiro(file)
spiro_summary(gxt_data)

spiro_plot(gxt_data)
```
