## Overview

This R package offers a fast, standardized and reproducible workflow
for data cardiopulmonary exercise testing. It offers tools for  
data import, processing, summary and visualization. 

> WARNING: This package is currently under development. At the moment, I
recommend to use it for demonstration or testing purposes only. When using
`spiro` for scientific analyses, make sure to state the exact package version,
as at this stage of development the package's functions may undergo major
changes.

## Installation

Install the current development version from GitHub:

``` {r install-dev, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("smnnlt/spiro")
```

Install the latest version 0.0.1 release by running this code:

``` {r install, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("smnnlt/spiro@v0.0.1")
```

## Usage

* Use `spiro()` to automatically import and process raw data from
  cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
* Use `spiro_summary()` and `spiro_max()` for a stepwise summary or the 
  calculation of maximum parameter values.
* Use `spiro_plot()` to visualize the data.
  
#### Metabolic Carts

The following metabolic carts are currently supported by `spiro`:

* Cortex
* Cosmed
* Vyntus
* ZAN

## Example

```{r example, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
library(spiro)

# get data path for example
file <- spiro_example("zan_gxt")

gxt_data <- spiro(file)

spiro_summary(gxt_data)

spiro_plot(gxt_data)
```
